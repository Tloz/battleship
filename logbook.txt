TODO:
* Find a way to tell when a ship has sunk.
Not possible with actual implementation
Hint: maybe change shoot map param to player, and implement a ship array in player struct
Other way: change possible values on the map. Each boat square has 2 possible value,
depending on boat type: sink or not. Just have to count sink value for each boat

* Secure input in ask_and_place_boat.
Actually causes endless loop on typing a char before any number.
Empty stdin buffer didn't work
